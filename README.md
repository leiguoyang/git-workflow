# Git Introduction

## Why use git (The benefit)

By using a version control system. You can get

- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes? /* Add an diff compare image here */
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?

## Git workflow

1. Create a new branch. For example, to add new feature or modify sth.
2. Make changes. Here you can compare the diffs between versions.
3. Open a pull request. For discussion, double check and approval.
4. Merge.
5. Deploy.

## Git command
